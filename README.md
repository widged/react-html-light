# React-html-light

This is a very lightweight version, for the web browser, of the React primitives `StyleSheet`,`View`,`Text`,`Image`,`Touchable` that are already in use react-native, react-sketchapp, or react-vr.

It is meant to be used only in developpement mode, to simplify imports. For production, best is to rely on [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) or [expo-web](https://blog.expo.io/expo-cli-and-sdk-web-support-beta-d0c588221375)
